"johnny crow would dig and sow  till he made a little garden  and the lion  had a green and yellow tie on  in johnny crow's garden  and the rat wore a feather in his hat  but the bear had nothing to wear  in johnny crow's garden  so the ape  took his measure with a tape  in johnny crow's garden  then the crane  was caught in the rain  in johnny crow's garden  and the beaver was afraid he had a fever  but the goat said:  it's nothing but his throat!  in johnny crow's garden  and the pig danced a jig  in johnny crow's garden  then the stork gave a philosophic talk  till the hippopotami said: ask no further 'what am i?'  while the elephant said something quite irrelevant  and the goose-- well  the goose was a goose  in johnny crow's garden  and the mouse  built himself a little house  where the cat  sat down beside the mat  in johnny crow's garden  and the whale  told a very long tale  in johnny crow's garden  and the owl was a funny old fowl  and the fox  put them all in the stocks  in johnny crow's garden  but johnny crow he let them go  and they all sat down to their dinner in a row  in johnny crow's garden    good-bye!"@"johnny crow's garden"@"leslie brooke"
